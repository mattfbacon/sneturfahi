## Thanks

I would like to thank la kanba, srasu, elfein, and Nts√©kees for helping to make design decisions and answer Lojban questions during the development of sneturfahi.

Most of this discussion occurred in the `#proga` channel in jbobratca ([invite](https://discord.gg/BVm4EYR)). Additionally, the more important discussions are documented in the `discussions` directory of this repository. I am `selnunsne` in those discussions.
